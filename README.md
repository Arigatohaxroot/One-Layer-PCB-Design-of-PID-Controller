# One-Layer-PCB-Design-of-Analog-PID-Controller
In this I have made one layer  design of PID Controller using proteus.
For this I have to use 2x 3-pin T-block to provide +15V -15V and ground
I'm using LM741 op-amp IC for this circuit.
Proteus file is also attached with schematic and PCB design and Report file.
# Here is the schematic diagram
